# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

# Note:
# Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

# what does it mean by a 32-bit signed integer range? https://www.quora.com/What-is-32-bit-signed-integer?share=1

# when do I return 0 -- when does the integer 'overflow'? 
# value limits:
# max: (2^31) - 1
# least: -(2^31)

# 31 being the max bits it can show a number, the 32th bit is for the sign.

# otherwise it looks like I am taking an integer, and reversing the places but not the sign

# in example 3, the zero that would be in the front was taken off, and in example 4 where there is a zero it returned zero. 

 

# Example 1:

# Input: x = 123
# Output: 321

# Example 2:

# Input: x = -123
# Output: -321

# Example 3:

# Input: x = 120
# Output: 21

# Example 4:

# Input: x = 0
# Output: 0
